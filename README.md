# @babbage/sdk

Build Babbage apps in JavaScript

**[NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babbage/sdk)**

## Introduction

This library provides a client-side authentication solution that will let your application access a few
cryptographic keys that belong to your users. You can use these for client-side encryption/decryption,
authentication, signing, or even creating Bitcoin transactions.

### Data Ownership

Traditionally, internet-based businesses have owned all their users' data. They use this data for advertising,
analytics, tracking and many other purposes. This library enables a new modelâ€”a model in which the users
themselves remain the sole owners and custodians of the data they generate with your application. The same user will always have the same set of keys, even if they recover their account or
log in on a new device:

Key Name            | Description
\--------------------|-----------------------
Primary Key         | Use this key for low-security symmetric cryptography
Privileged Key      | Use this key for high-security symmetric cryptography

### One Set of Keys per User

Each user has one set of keys. Their keys can be used only on their devices and only with their permission.
Generally, all of a user's applications will share a common set of keys. This makes it possible for multiple
applications to access the same sets of data. For example, two competing Twetch UIs could compete in
representing the same pieces of content.

### No Server-side Access to Keys

We take steps to protect the security of user keys, in an attempt to ensure that they are not exported or extracted. While
it's not technologically impossible to steal a user's keys and send them to your servers, since you do not own
the keys, exceeding your authorized level of access is a violation of the law in most countries.

### Monetization

How, then, are you to make money with your applications? When user data is encrypted and inaccessible,
traditional ad-based monetization techniques don't work. We envision a new era of micropayment-based
monetization schemes powered by a world-scale blockchain such as BSV. You could, for example, sell access to
your API for 1000 satoshis per request. Ad-free video sharing platforms could charge $0.0001 per minute of
video played, sending 80% to the creator of the video and 20% to the platform's owners. A music streaming
service could charge $0.05 per song, splitting each payment in a similar way.

### PKI-based User Certification

Since a set of keys is tied directly to a user, they can get their keys endorsed by well-known public
certificate authorities. For example, if MIT signed off whenever someone got a degree, you could trivially
implement a social network exclusively for MIT graduates.

### Differences between Primary and Privileged Keysets

The primary keyset and the privileged keyset have the same properties, except that the privileged keyset is for
use in more secure contexts. For example, if implementing a secure messaging application, the primary keyset
should generally be used for most communications. When sending something like a "secret chat" or a "confidential attachment",
the privileged keyset should be used to encrypt/decrypt or sign/verify the data.

### Access to the Privileged keyset

You can access `privilegedKey` and `privilegedSigning` with the functions defined in the API section below. If
they haven't been accessed for more than the length of time defined by `privilegedKeyTimeout`, the
user will need to enter their password in order to unlock the key. Therefore, the promises returned by
functions that make use of privileged keysets may take 30+ seconds to resolve while the user enters their
password.

## Installation

    npm i @babbage/sdk

## Example Usage

```js
const { encrypt, decrypt } = require('@babbage/sdk')

// Encrypt and decrypt data using the BabbageSDK
const encryptedData = await encrypt({
    plaintext: Buffer.from('some data'),
    protocolID: 'Hello World',
    keyID: '1',
  })
const decryptedData = await decrypt({
    ciphertext: encryptedData,
    protocolID: 'Hello World',
    keyID: '1',
    returnType: 'string'
  })
```

### createAction

Creates and broadcasts a BitCoin transaction with the provided inputs and outputs.

#### Parameters

*   `obj` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** All parameters for this function are provided in an object

    *   `obj.inputs` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)?** Input scripts to spend as part of this Action. This is an object whose keys are TXIDs and whose values are Everett-style transaction envelopes that contain an additional field called `outputsToRedeen`. This additional field is an array of objects, each containing `index` and `unlockingScript` properties. The `index` property is the output number in the transaction you are spending, and `unlockingScript` is the hex-encoded Bitcoin script that unlocks and spends the output. Any signatures should be created with `SIGHASH_NONE | ANYONECANPAY` so that additional modifications to the resulting transaction can be made afterward without invalidating them. You may substitute `SIGHASH_NONE` for `SIGHASH_SINGLE` if required for a token contract, or drop `ANYONECANPAY` if you are self-funding the Action.
    *   `obj.outputs` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)<[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)>?** The array of transaction outputs (amounts and scripts) that you want in the transaction. Each object contains "satoshis" and "script", which can be any custom locking script of your choosing.
    *   `obj.description` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** A present-tense description of the user Action being facilitated or represented by this BitCoin transaction.
    *   `obj.bridges` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)<[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)>** Bridgeport bridges to notify about this Action. (optional, default `[]`)

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)>** An Action object containing "txid", "rawTx" "mapiResponses" and "inputs".
